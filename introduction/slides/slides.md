# üß¨ Introduction to GraphQL

**Facilitator:** Alberto Camarena
**Presented at:** Global Hack Week üåê
**Date:** 15/04/25 üìÖ

---

## üìö Workshop Overview

### Sessions

1. **GraphQL Fundamentals & Querying**
2. **Building a GraphQL Backend**
3. **Creating a Frontend with GraphQL**

### Objectives

- Understand what GraphQL is and how it compares to REST
- Learn the core components of GraphQL
- Build a GraphQL server
- Develop a frontend that queries the GraphQL API

---

## üß† What is GraphQL?

> A query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.

- Developed by Facebook in 2012, open-sourced in 2015
- Single endpoint API
- Schema-based, strongly typed
- Reduces over-fetching and under-fetching

## üÜö REST vs. GraphQL

| Feature             | REST                | GraphQL            |
|--------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Endpoints          | Multiple            | Single             |
| Data Fetching      | Fixed structure     | Flexible queries   |
| Over/Under-fetching| Common              | Avoided            |
| Versioning         | URI-based           | Schema evolution   |
| Introspection      | Not supported       | Built-in           |

## üèóÔ∏è GraphQL Core Concepts

### Schema

Defines the API structure using types and fields.

### Operation Types

- `Query`: Read operations
- `Mutation`: Write operations
- `Subscription`: Real-time updates (optional)

### Resolver

Functions that fetch the data for a field.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Deep Dive: GraphQL Schemas & Types

- **Schema as a Contract:**  
  - Defines the available data and operations for clients.
  - Serves as a single source of truth between client and server.

```graphql
  type Query {
    me: User
  }
  
  type User {
    name: String
  }
```

---

- **Types Explained:**
  - **Scalar Types:**  
    - Fundamental data types like `String`, `Int`, `Float`, `Boolean`, `ID`.
  - **Object Types:**  
    - Custom types that define objects with specific fields.
  - **Advanced Types:**  
    - **Enums:** A set of predefined values.
    - **Interfaces & Unions:** For shared fields and flexible type relations.
    - **Input Types:** For complex arguments in mutations.

---

## üîç Operation Type: Query

- **Purpose:**  
  - Read and fetch data from the server.
- **How It Works:**  
  - Defined in your schema as a `Query` type.
  - Each query field connects to a resolver that retrieves the corresponding data.
- **Analogy:**  
  - Equivalent to HTTP GET in REST.
  
üîó [GraphQL Queries Documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/)


---

## ‚ú® Example Query

```graphql
query GetCountry {
  country(code: "BR") {
    name
    capital
    emoji
    currency
    languages {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

‚úÖ Ask only for the data you need

## ‚úçÔ∏è Operation Type: Mutation

- **Purpose:**  
  - Create, update, or delete data.
- **How It Works:**  
  - Defined in the schema as a `Mutation` type.
  - Each mutation field is tied to a resolver that performs the corresponding write or data-changing action.
- **Analogy:**  
  - Similar to HTTP POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE in REST.
  
üîó [GraphQL Mutations Documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations)

---

## ‚ö° Operation Type: Subscription

- **Purpose:**  
  - Provide real-time updates to clients.
- **How It Works:**  
  - Defined in your schema as a `Subscription` type.
  - Uses resolvers to setup a live connection (often via WebSocket) to push data as events occur.
- **Analogy:**  
  - Comparable to a live feed or real-time socket connection.

## ü´∞ Understanding Resolvers: The Heart of GraphQL

- **What Are Resolvers?**  
  - Functions that actually fetch the data for each field in your schema.
- **How Resolvers Work:**  
  - Each field in the GraphQL query is connected to a resolver.
  - **Resolver Function Arguments:**  
    - `parent`: The result from the parent field.
    - `args`: Input arguments provided in the query.
    - `context`: Shared context (e.g., authentication info, data loaders).
    - `info`: Information about the execution state (e.g., field AST).

---

- **Example Resolver in Action:**

```javascript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    post: (parent, args, context, info) => {
      // 'args' contains the parameters such as `id`
      return postsData.find(post => post.id === args.id);
    }
  },
  // Other resolvers for mutations and nested types...
};
```

## üß≤ Bringing It All Together

- **Integration of Components:**
  1. **Schemas & Types:**  
     - Define the *what*: the data structure and operations available (Queries, Mutations, Subscriptions).
  2. **Resolvers:**  
     - Define the *how*: the functions that fetch or modify the data for each schema field.
  3. **Operation Types:**  
     - **Query:** Retrieves data (read-only).  
     - **Mutation:** Changes data (create, update, delete).  
     - **Subscription:** Delivers real-time data updates.

---

- **Workflow Overview:**  
  1. **Design the Schema:** Outline your types, queries mutations, and (optionally) subscriptions.
  2. **Implement Resolvers:** Write functions to fulfill the schema‚Äôs requirements.
  3. **Test and Iterate:** Use GraphQL playgrounds to run queries and adjust your implementation.
- **Best Practices:**  
  - Keep resolvers focused and simple.
  - Modularize your schema for better maintainability.
  - Leverage context for shared data operations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On: Querying a Public API

### Use: [https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app](https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/)

Example:
```graphql
{
  allPeople {
    people {
      name
      gender
    }
  }
}
```

üß™ Try it in GraphiQL or Apollo Sandbox!
